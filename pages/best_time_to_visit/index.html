                    <p>Set amidst the rustic Aravalli mountain ranges and the golden-sandy Thar Desert, Rajasthan is
                        indeed
                        a
                        place that is unparalleled and in it is true in its own right. Bordered by the states of Punjab,
                        Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, and the Pakistani provinces of Punjab and
                        Sindh,
                        Rajasthan holds many gems and secrets within its borders that have always managed to interest
                        and
                        draw
                        tourists from different parts of India as well as from all over the world.
                        From majestic forts, such as those of Amer and Mehrangarh, and significant religious attractions
                        like
                        the Dilwara Jain temples and Karni Mata temple, to spell-binding royal structures, such as the
                        Umaid
                        Bhawan palace, Rajasthan has it all. Comprising of both exotic destinations, such as Udaipur,
                        Jaipur,
                        Jodhpur, and Jaisalmer, as well as quaint, rural settings like that of Bundi and Alwar, the
                        state of
                        Rajasthan has something or the other to offer to all kinds of tourists.</p>

                        Despite being popular among tourists as the dessert-state of India, Rajasthan is rich in flora
                        and
                        fauna
                        as well, as it also home to a plethora of national parks and wildlife sanctuaries that are
                        located
                        in
                        the state. Home to peculiarities, such as the world’s oldest ploughing field, the nation’s
                        largest
                        district, and the oldest mountain range as well as colour coded cities, Rajasthan promises to
                        exceed
                        the
                        expectations of all those who decide to visit it.
                        The best time to visit Rajasthan will mostly depend on what you plan to do when you visit the
                        state.
                        While the summers are rather hot in Rajasthan, they may not be the best time to visit Rajasthan,
                        as
                        the
                        temperatures may severely impact your sightseeing schedules, winters are generally considered to
                        be
                        the
                        best season to visit Rajasthan. However, it all depends on what you plan to do and how much you
                        can
                        stand the heat. Some knowledge about what the temperature and weather is like during the year
                        can
                        help
                        you in better planning your itinerary.
